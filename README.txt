FLAPPY BIRD

This is a project that I made for a web development class.

I do not take credit for the original idea of the game and this is basically a clone of Flappy Bird by Dong Nguyen. However, I did create most of the sprites for this version, except for the 'Ready' graphic which I edited from a Flappy Bird graphic. 

The reason that I used a bat instead of a bird was because I believed it would make more sense for a bat in a cave to dodge obstacles (stalactites and stalagmites) than for a bird to be dodging pipes that seemingly come from nowhere (at least the top ones). Plus, I thought it would be a fun little challenge to see if I could draw a cave and a bat successfully.

As my first project writing the complete css, javascript, and html for the entire thing, I am pretty proud. However, there are things that I hope to get better at. For instance, if I had more time, it might be cool to do the project with Canvas rather than just manipultaing divs on the page (it might also be more efficient, but I'm not sure yet).
